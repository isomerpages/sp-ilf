<p>The Learning Express programme is an overseas student programme started
by SP to create an immersive learning platform for students from different
nations, cultures and academic disciplines to learn and apply Design Thinking
collaboratively by working on authentic projects that solve local problems
in the host countries. SP works with a network of Institutes of Higher
Learning across ASEAN, China and India to implement the programme and also
takes the lead to host the LeX Conference for all the partners periodically
to create opportunities for sharing of success stories and exchange of
best practices. The Learning Express Conference 2024 also serves as an
opportune occasion to commemorate 10 years of LeX since it was started
in 2013.</p>
